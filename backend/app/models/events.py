"""WebSocket progress event models.

All events published to Redis pubsub (channel `job:{job_id}:events`) and forwarded to connected WebSocket clients must conform to one of the variants in `ProgressEvent`.
The discriminator field `type` lets the frontend (and any Python consumer) deserialise without a manual if-chain.
