"""Scout — research agent.

Breaks a user topic into sub-questions, runs each sub-question through Exa, falls back to trafilatura when Exa returns no body text, deduplicates by URL, and produces a final list of `Source` records. Each source's credibility blends a domain-prior heuristic (`app.services.credibility`) with a per-source LLM rating; relevance comes from the same LLM pass.

The agent class is pure: it exposes async methods that take and return data. Event publishing and graph state lives in the LangGraph node wrapper (`app.agents.scout_graph`) so the agent stays trivially unit-testable in isolation.
